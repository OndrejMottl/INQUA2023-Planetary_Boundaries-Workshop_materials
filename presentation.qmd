## PAGES Planetary Boundaries WG

-	Holocene variability is a key component of planetary boundaries concept
-	Focus on temporal dynamics / safe operating spaces

## Steffen et al. 2009

::: {.center-xy}

"*To meet the challenge of maintaining the Holocene state, we propose a framework based on 'planetary boundaries'. These boundaries define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the Earth system and are associated with the planet's biophysical subsystems or processes.*"

## Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- How can we use palaeoecological (and related fields) data to address the planetary boundaries concept?

## Example from pollen data

- Focus on temporal dynamics
-	We need:
  1. a metric (or series of metrics) that can reflect something related to the planetary boundary
  2. a method for describing the variability (e.g. a generalised additive model)
  3. to look at multiple records (if we are talking global planetary boundaries), so need a reproducible method for data synthesis and analyses.

## 1. Metric

### Ecosystem diversity metrics 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
-	Richness, evenness etc., can be estimated using Hill Numbers
-	One component of 'Ecosystem Condition' (see, e.g. Dearing et al. 2014)
-	Other metrics are available!

## 2. method for describing the variability

### GAMs: a generalised additive models

-	Statistical model - non-linear trends through time
-	Gavin Simpson - transition of GAMs to palaeoecological data (Simpson 2018, Presentation on Wednesday, 11-11.15)
-	Models a trend (e.g. diversity against time) using a series of basis functions

---

## GAMs

## GAMs

-	'Generalised' framework - highly flexible, used on multiple data types
-	it doesn't tell us where the boundary is, but statistically robust description of the variability (we can make informed decisions)

---

## 3. reproducible workflows

-	If integrating across multiple sites, then it is important to have standardized data that are comparable
-	In pollen this means- same depositional environment, same age-depth models, same levels of taxonomic harmonisation, (same/ similar temporal resolution), comparable temporal ranges etc.
-	We have been developing reproducible workflows for pollen data in the HOPE project, we will show an example of this today (see Ondrej's poster)

## FOSSILPOL

## Aims of this practical exercise

1.	Give an example data preparation and analysis of one metric (related to the Biodiversity Planetary Boundary).
2.	Give hands-on practice of applying the code to other examples.
3.	Stimulate some discussion points related to the types of metrics / standardization procedures that are relevant for your data and for the Planetary Boundaries' concepts

## Wrap up

-	Used this example of how to process the pollen data in standardized methodology
-	See the whole workflow which enables you to do this on Neotoma and other datasets (FOSSILPOL).
-	Interpretation of results in relation to the Planetary Boundaries would be open ended, and is the focus of the group and for discussion here.

---

## Discussion points

- Here we focused on temporal dynamics, but how can we get from response to control variables?
-	What other metrics/ ecosystem components could be used on pollen data? What about other proxy types
-	What would be the challenges of doing large syntheses in the context of the planetary boundaries for your data types?
